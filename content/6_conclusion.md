I created this bibliometric visualization for the ongoing [Taylor Wilderness Research Station](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/taylor-archive/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} digital collection to understand the research impact by visualizing the output of students and professors that studied there and how many times their work was cited over time. Considering this visualization was created *only* using the Web of Science database, we hope that VERSO can help us understand even more complex relationships of out scholarly output at U of I, harvesting from multiple databases and including work beyond peer reviewed content, including creative and outreach activities.

**In closing**, I encourage each of you to explore your VERSO profile today and start adding content to ensure your research is represented and preserved. We at the library hope you utilize VERSO to help highlight your scholarly output, contribute to lasting digital preservation and connect your work to potential collaborators. 

If you have any questions about the material I went over today, please see the site I created for this presentation which has links to all of the material Iâ€™ve discussed and always feel free to reach out to [myself](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [any members of the team leading this project for more information](lib-verso@uidaho.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

Thank you
